        <h1>Pension Holder Survey Guidance</h1>
        <div class="survey-guidance">
            <p>If you're a Lewisham pension holder, you should have received an email and letter from the Council with a survey about your pension. You might have received it in your spam folder.</p>

            <p>This survey is taking place after tireless work and continued pressure from over 3,000 local residents and pension holders who want the council to stop its investments in <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/a-hrc-59-23-from-economy-of-occupation-to-economy-of-genocide-report-special-rapporteur-francesca-albanese-palestine-2025/">the apartheid and genocide economy, as recommended by the United Nations</a> and our investments are financially safe. This local movement is part of a worldwide citizen-led campaign.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lewisham's pension fund forms part of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), managed by the council on behalf of employees and pension holders. Councils are legally required to act in members' financial interests but should also consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.</li>
                <li>Local campaigners and residents have argued that the Council should review and, where necessary, divest from companies involved in human-rights controversies or the arms trade. The Council has been discussing this issue for over a year and recently launched this survey to gather views from members.</li>
                <li>To ensure your view is represented, and to safeguard our pensions from human rights abuses, complete the survey and highlight: "Your support for human-rights and ethical investment principles; The importance of transparency and accountability in council pension decisions."</li>
                <li><strong>Pension holders should have a genuine say in how their money is invested.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/a-hrc-59-23-from-economy-of-occupation-to-economy-of-genocide-report-special-rapporteur-francesca-albanese-palestine-2025/">companies that the United Nations have flagged</a> as directly linked with conflict zones and human rights violations, including those in Palestine, are becoming financially risky assets. Lewisham currently holds at least £68 million in such investments.</p>

            <p>These investments are not only morally wrong, but also financially reckless. When a local pension fund holds large sums in companies linked to human rights risks, it faces heightened volatility and stakeholder-exit risk. In contrast, ethical companies are often the most financially sustainable and viable investments. This was the argument for Lewisham's £800m divestment from fossil fuels in 2022, it was also the argument for divesting from companies involved in the South African apartheid.</p>

            <p>The Council has said the survey will help shape its investment approach. We need to make sure everyone's voices are heard and our investments are financially safe. However, some pension holders have raised concerns that the questions don't directly address issues like human rights, arms manufacturing, or investments in occupied territories. Although the Council has already agreed to look into human rights abuses, it is taking too long. It has already been over a year, and the international situation is worsening</p>

            <p>Over 1 in 33 Palestinians have lost their lives over the past 24 months, including 20,000 children, and 1 in 14 are facing life-threatening injuries. Urgent action is needed to divest from companies profiting from this death and destruction.</p>

            <p><strong>If you would like the Council to prioritise ethical, climate friendly and human-rights-based investment in the future:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Please complete the survey, and encourage your colleagues to do the same.</li>
                <li>Ask for an ethical pension (Q10 - fourth or fifth option)</li>
                <li>Select "Human rights" as your top concern (Q15 and Q20)</li>
                <li>Write in both of the boxes (Q14 and Q22) that you demand immediate divestment from companies complicit in the apartheid and genocide economy, and commitment to not invest in companies linked to human rights abuses.</li>
            </ol>
