        <h1>Pension Holder Survey Guidance</h1>
        <div class="survey-guidance">
            <p>If you’re a Lewisham pension holder, you will have received an email from the Council with a survey about your pension. This survey is taking place after continued pressure from local residents and pension holders who are outraged that Lewisham has over £68 million of our pension money invested in companies involved in Israel's genocide and apartheid in Palestine.</p>
            <p>The Council claimed that pension holders would have a say on this issue through the survey, but they lied. None of the questions address the topic. The Council has designed the survey to manipulate pension holders and get the answers they want.</p>
            <p><strong>If you want divestment from Israel:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://consultation.lewisham.gov.uk/corporate-resources/bbfd0bd9/">Complete the survey</a></li>
                <li>Ask for an ethical pension (Q10 - fourth or fifth option)</li>
                <li>Select “Human rights” as your top concern (Q15 and Q20), even if the other options are also important</li>
                <li>Write in both of the boxes (Q14 and Q22) that you demand immediate divestment from companies complicit in Israel’s genocide and apartheid</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Full explanation:</h2>
            <p>If you are a Lewisham pension holder, you have been sent a survey about your pension. This survey is happening in part because of campaigning by Lewisham residents and pension holders. Although most workers get to control their own pensions, the council gets to decide how our pensions are invested. They have chosen to continue investing in companies that are involved in Israel's genocide and apartheid in Palestine. This includes the company that provides AI targeting technology to Israel's military, and companies that are helping to expand Israel's illegal settlements.</p>

            <p>Campaigners don't want our pension money invested in these companies and have asked the council to stop doing this. The council have discussed this in meetings for more than a year but have not changed anything yet. The council have now said they will ask for the views of all pension holders.</p>

            <p>Once you see the survey, you will realise that the council is not really interested in your views about your pension. There are many problems with the survey:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The survey does not ask about how you feel about the investments in companies supporting Israel's genocide or apartheid.</strong> The survey does not ask about how you feel about investments in conflict or occupied territories. The council have lied to pension holders about this. Before the survey was launched, they were asked if it would include questions about "investments in occupied territories and the arms trade ... so people have an open chance to say yes or no". The council responded that "the survey will be comprehensive, it will be wide-ranging, and it will ask the views of [pension] members with regards to armaments, conflict ... so yes". But actually, pension holders are not given a chance to say 'yes' or 'no' on these issues.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> There are two text boxes on the survey (Q14, Q22) where you can write what you like. Tell the council in your own words that you demand immediate divestment from companies complicit in Israel's genocide and apartheid.</li>

                <li><strong>The survey is too long and too complicated.</strong> Lewisham council refused to work with pension holders to help develop the survey. This is standard practice in research and helps to make sure that a survey is accessible to everyone. It appears the council designed the survey to be inaccessible and to deliberately exclude some pension holders from responding.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> The complicated details may be intended to put you off from responding to the survey. Do not be put off!</li>

                <li><strong>Instead of just asking pension holders how important different issues are to them, the survey forces a cruel 'ranking' of issues.</strong> This suggests we have to choose between caring about e.g. genocide, modern slavery or climate change. This helps the council to hide from calls to divest from Israel's genocide - they can point to other issues that are also important to people, or argue that there are many issues that are equally important.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> do not get caught in the council's cruel game. Select 'Human rights' as your top concern (Q15, Q20) to advance the cause of divestment - even if other issues are also really important. (see below)</li>

                <li><strong>The issue in the survey with the most relevance to Israel's genocide and apartheid is 'Human rights, ensuring that the companies we invest in are not complicit in the violation of international human rights laws' (Q20).</strong> However many pension holders will not make a connection to Israel and Palestine here - people may think about entirely separate human rights issues such as international labour exploitation or sweat shops, or could simply be confused about what the text means. Nonetheless, the council may claim they can use this question to understand the level of support for divestment from Israel's genocide and apartheid.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> Recognise that the council are trying to minimise the issue of Israel's genocide and apartheid. However, choosing 'Human rights' as your top concern (Q15, Q20) - even if the other issues are also really important - is still the best way of advancing divestment from Israel's genocide and apartheid.</li>

                <li><strong>The survey asks how you feel about 'Defence, ensuring that we recognise the need for defence whilst also seeking to prevent the proliferation of weapons' (Q20).</strong> By choosing this option it is not clear if you are saying you want your pension to be invested in arms companies or not. Some people are happy to have their pensions invested in arms companies; others do not want their money to be used to help kill people. Because of the political connections between arms companies and politicians, Lewisham council are unwilling to give pension holders a real choice about what is done with their money. If this seems wrong, it is - legal guidance for councils makes clear that it is the opinion of pension holders and not employers or pension scheme managers that should matter here.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> Take a moment to get angry - Lewisham council think that you are not allowed to have an opinion about your own money being invested in arms companies.</li>

                <li><strong>The survey suggests that there is some trade off between having an ethical pension and lower investment returns (Q10).</strong> This is not true - the council are trying to make you fearful about asking for an ethical pension. <a href="https://www.pensionbee.com/uk/blog/2024/november/does-socially-responsible-investing-make-financial-sense">Ethical companies are often the most financially sustainable and viable investments</a>. But in any case, the council is able to responsibly remove your money from the handful of companies profiting from Israel's genocide and apartheid without any meaningful financial impact.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> Do not be afraid of asking for an ethical pension. In Q10, select the fifth option - 'My pension fund investments should actively contribute to positive impacts on society, communities and the environment, and avoid negative ones' - or the fourth option if you prefer.</li>

                <li><strong>The survey asks for your opinion on 'Engagement' (Q12, Q13).</strong> This is a technical matter which probably should never have been included in the survey. But to explain, pension managers can sometimes 'engage' with companies they are invested in - this means they try to get companies to change their behaviour and stop doing bad things. 'Engagement' can work in some cases; however 'engagement' is a waste of time if the company is not likely to change its behaviour. For example, some of the companies which Lewisham have invested our pensions in are Israeli companies that have been called out by the UN for years for abusing the rights of Palestinians; there is no chance that 'engagement' will work in these cases. So you can see that there is no one single answer to whether 'engagement' is a good thing - it depends on the situation - all of us support 'engagement' if it works. However 'engagement' is also a standard trick used by pension managers because it allows them to justify keeping their investments in unethical companies; instead of doing nothing for years they can say they are 'engaging'. So if pension holders show support for 'engagement' in the survey this may be used by the council as cover for doing nothing to address campaigners' concerns.<br><br><strong>We recommend:</strong> As explained above, the questions on engagement (Q12, Q13) are largely meaningless - however you may wish to select the option that calls for things to happen 'as soon as possible' (Q13). There is a text box at the end of the section on engagement (Q14). Use it to tell the council in your own words that you demand immediate divestment from companies complicit in Israel's genocide and apartheid.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In summary, it appears that the council have taken a cynical and manipulative approach to this survey of pension holders. Remember that this is about our money - when it comes to our pensions, they work for us. Campaigners will be seeking to hold the council to account for this. You can help by ensuring that your colleagues and other pension holders also have access to this guidance, so they are able to make an informed decision about how to respond to the survey.</p>
